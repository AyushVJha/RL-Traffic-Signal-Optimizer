# 🚦 RL-Powered Traffic Signal Optimizer

A reinforcement learning project that trains an agent to dynamically control a 4-way traffic signal using Deep Q-Learning. The goal is to minimize vehicle congestion and waiting time using intelligent policy learning.

## Problem Statement

Traditional traffic signals use fixed timers, which fail to adapt to real-time conditions. This project simulates an **adaptive RL-based signal controller** that:
- Observes the traffic queue on all four sides
- Decides whether to keep North–South or East–West signal green
- Learns to minimize congestion and queue buildup

## Model & Training Stats

- **Episodes Trained**: 200
- **Average Reward**: `-604` per 100-step episode (improved from ~-800 baseline)
- **FPS**: ~2600
- **Policy**: Fully trained DQN with epsilon decay to 0.05
- **Model Saved**:Yes (`models/dqn_traffic_model.zip`)
